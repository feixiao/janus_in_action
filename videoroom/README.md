# React Janus Components
React components for Janus Plugins including Videoroom

Purpose of this module is to implement the multiple plugins of [Janus](http://janus.conf.meetecho.com) to be used with React apps. The janus.js from the official demo is used as the client library for the moment. This would be converted to a node module at a latter stage.

## Update

npm package had an issue yesterday, fixed now and the example should work

## Supported plugins
1. Videoroom

## Usage

1. Install Janus server, docker image is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/manujith/janus
2. Follow the example for Videoroom
